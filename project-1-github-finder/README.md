# Project 1 - GitHub Finder

**Final Project: [Netlify](https://musing-blackwell-a6e98d.netlify.app/)**

## Aims

The aim of this project was to make a web application that utilises the GitHub API to search for user profiles and show more details for individual profiles.

## Process

The webapp was made using `create-react-app`, and was initially using class components and vanilla JS.

After a few lectures I added TypeScript as I prefer this to Javascript - as a result of this there are differences compared to the course code.

Class components were slowly refactored into function components throughout the lectures for this project. The lectures also introduced React routing, state and eventually hooks and context.

## Thoughts

I probably made things harder/longer by trying to use TypeScript at the same time as learning React from a source not based in TS, but I feel like this forced me to learn and understand some of the fundamentals more.

React is something I'm going to be looking into using more when it comes to personal projects - I feel there is less effort to go through setting up a project than with Angular 2.

There are 2 more projects left in this course and I'm looking forward to doing them.
